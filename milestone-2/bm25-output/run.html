Assume that a user is interested in a particular family movie, it is appealing if a multimedia recommendation system can suggest other movies, music, books, and paintings closely related to the movie. We propose a comprehensive, personalized multimedia recommendation system, denoted MudRecS, which makes recommendations on movies, music, books, and paintings similar in content to other movies, music, books, and/or paintings that a MudRecS user is interested in. MudRecS does not rely on users' access patterns/histories, connection information extracted from social networking sites, collaborated filtering methods, or user personal attributes (such as gender and age) to perform the recommendation task. It simply considers the users' ratings, genres, role players (authors or artists), and reviews of different multimedia items, which are abundant and easy to find on the Web. MudRecS predicts the ratings of multimedia items that match the interests of a user to make recommendations. The performance of MudRecS has been compared with current state-ofthe-art multimedia recommenders using various multimedia datasets, and the experimental results show that MudRecS significantly outperforms other systems in accurately predicting the ratings of multimedia items to be recommended.

Assume that a user is interested in a particular family movie, it is appealing if a multimedia recommendation system can suggest other movies, music, books, and paintings closely related to the movie. We propose a comprehensive, personalized multimedia recommendation system, denoted MudRecS, which makes recommendations on movies, music, books, and paintings similar in content to other movies, music, books, and/or paintings that a MudRecS user is interested in. MudRecS does not rely on users' access patterns/histories, connection information extracted from social networking sites, collaborated filtering methods, or user personal attributes (such as gender and age) to perform the recommendation task. It simply considers the users' ratings, genres, role players (authors or artists), and reviews of different multimedia items, which are abundant and easy to find on the Web. MudRecS predicts the ratings of multimedia items that match the interests of a user to make recommendations. The performance of MudRecS has been compared with current state-ofthe-art multimedia recommenders using various multimedia datasets, and the experimental results show that MudRecS significantly outperforms other systems in accurately predicting the ratings of multimedia items to be recommended.

In this paper, aiming at providing a general method for improving recommender systems by incorporating social network information, we propose a matrix factorization framework with social regularization. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: (1) We elaborate how social network information can benefit recommender systems; (2) We interpret the differences between social-based recommender systems and trust-aware recommender systems; (3) We coin the term Social Regularization to represent the social constraints on recommender systems, and we systematically illustrate how to design a matrix factorization objective function with social regularization; and (4) The proposed method is quite general, which can be easily extended to incorporate other contextual information, like social tags, etc. The empirical analysis on two large datasets demonstrates that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

We have also incorporated learnings from our experience with recommendation systems in production, in order to enhance ease of use; speed of implementation and deployment; scalability and performance.

Moreover, a lot of linguistic knowledge is used in the natural language processing (NLP) system for improving the system. Therefore, the necessity of co-occurrence word information in the natural language processing system increases further and various researches using co-occurrence word information are done. Moreover, in the natural language processing, dictionary is necessary and indispensable because the ability of the entire system is controlled by the amount and the quality of the dictionary. In this paper, the importance of co-occurrence word information in the natural language processing system was described. The classification technique of the co-occurrence word (receiving word) and the co-occurrence frequency was described and the classified group was expressed hierarchically. Moreover, this paper proposes a technique for an automatic construction system and a complete thesaurus.

Moreover, a lot of linguistic knowledge is used in the natural language processing (NLP) system for improving the system. Therefore, the necessity of co-occurrence word information in the natural language processing system increases further and various researches using co-occurrence word information are done. Moreover, in the natural language processing, dictionary is necessary and indispensable because the ability of the entire system is controlled by the amount and the quality of the dictionary. In this paper, the importance of co-occurrence word information in the natural language processing system was described. The classification technique of the co-occurrence word (receiving word) and the co-occurrence frequency was described and the classified group was expressed hierarchically. Moreover, this paper proposes a technique for an automatic construction system and a complete thesaurus.
