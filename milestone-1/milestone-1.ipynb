    "The hardest part has been definitely working with new applications like tira, docker and git. There have been many problems to make them work, but at least some solutions have been found. The easiest part has been python programming, because im the most familiar with this programming language. I didn't know though that you can add a dictionary to a list without declaring it first. Finding a theme was also more complicated, than I thought it would be. I didn't want to choose a theme, which would be too broad or too specific. I chose multimedia retrieval, because that iterests me the most at this point - and I'm very curious to find more about it."

On the other hand I had no practical experiences with docker and never heard about TIRA before which resulted in struggling to get started all things up on my system. But team work paid out because we were able to help each other. Finding a topic was a little heavy when you don't have examples you can orientate to, but I think finally I found a suitable one for the next milestones."

    "I broke my leg, so I could not be present at the labs. My team updated me on everything and in that way I could catch up with what I had missed. I was not involved in the creation of the json file. At least, I managed to install all needed programs. We were running in some problems when we were doing the tira excercise to import the dataset. We all are using a windows and it showed the error message that it could not find the desired docker. The Problem was solved when we wrote an email to Kai and could visit him. Apparently, the git bash could not deal with the commands, so when we switched to the windows powershell everything worked. For the creation of my topic, I used the anthology, which helped a lot to get an idea of the data and possible topics. I am a bit worried since my laptop was workking pretty slow, and working with the big dataset might become problematic."
